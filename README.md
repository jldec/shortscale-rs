Rust lib to convert numbers into English words.

This module was written as an exploration of JavaScript and Rust [documented here](https://jldec.me/forays-from-node-to-rust).

The [short scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales#Comparison),
has different words for each power of 1000.

This library expresses numbers from zero to thousands,
millions, billions, trillions, and quadrillions, up to 999_999_999_999_999_999.

### Function
```rust
pub fn shortscale(num: u64) -> String
```

### Example
```rust
use shortscale::shortscale;

assert_eq!(
    shortscale(420_000_999_015),
    "four hundred and twenty billion nine hundred \
    and ninety nine thousand and fifteen"
);
```

### String writer
For efficient writing into a mutable pre-allocated string.  
The performance difference is small and varies across systems.

```rust
pub fn shortscale_string_writer(s: &mut String, num: u64)
```

```rust
use shortscale::shortscale_string_writer;

let mut my_string = String::from("The number 27 in words is ");
my_string.reserve(1024); // pre-allocate capacity (for performance only)

shortscale_string_writer(&mut my_string, 27);
assert_eq!(my_string, "The number 27 in words is twenty seven");
```

### Extra
As a record of my first foray into rust, older implementations are preserved under
[shortscale::extra](https://docs.rs/shortscale/latest/shortscale/extra/index.html).

For benchmarks run `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg extra" cargo bench`

GitHub Actions, running on Ubuntu.

On MacOS Catalina 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 memory allocation appears to be a lot slower.

test g_string_join                       ... bench:       2,166 ns/iter (+/- 225)
```

### JavaScript

Running `npm run bench` on the JavaScript version at [jldec/shortscale](https://github.com/jldec/shortscale)
shows that JavaScript is really fast as well - faster on MacOS than my first 2 naive rust implementations.

> [!NOTE]
> More recent rust versions will complain about `unexpected "cfg" condition name: "extra"`.  
> This has been mitigated using the [lints.rust] unexpected_cfgs in Cargo.toml.
